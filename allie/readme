## Processing methods
All texts and summaries are processed in order to create a 'word_lookup.csv' file. This file maps every word to an integer index.
Then, the training data is processed such that each summary begins with a '<start>' token and ends with a '<stop>' token. Each word
is then mapped to the corresponding index. This indexed version of training bill data will be saved into 'encoded_train.csv'. These files
are for increased efficiency in subsequent runs of the program.
